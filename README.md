# CSC-501-Operating-Systems

> For each assignment there is corresponding PDF that has full description on what tasks need to be accomplished in that assignment. The folder named "TMP" contains all the files which I modified/added to existing basic code structure for XINU OS to accomplish the particular task.

 - PA0 - Basic kernel programming practice on XINU OS.
 
 - PA1 - Implemented two new scheduling policies, viz., Exponential Distribution Scheduler and Linux-like Scheduler in XINU OS to tackle starvation problem which is prevalent in traditional priority based scheduler policy in XINU.
 
 - PA2 - Implemented a memory mapping scheme in XINU with support for demand paging, backing store management and implemented page replacement policies like Second Chance & Aging.
 
 - PA3 - Implemented readers/writers lock system in XINU OS and implemented priority inheritance mechanism to avoid priority inversion problem which arises due to locking system.
